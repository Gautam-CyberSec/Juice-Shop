# OWASP Juice Shop Vulnerability Fix Recommendations

## Overview

This report provides professional step-by-step recommendations to fix the critical vulnerabilities identified during the penetration test of OWASP Juice Shop, specifically focusing on SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Insecure Login Flow (Brute Force Attack).


## Fixing SQL Injection

### Problem:
User inputs are directly embedded into SQL queries without sanitization, allowing malicious inputs like ' OR 1=1 -- to bypass authentication and extract sensitive data.

### Fix Steps:
1. Implement Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements) in the server-side code to ensure user input is treated as data, not code.
2. Use frameworks that automatically handle parameterized queries.
3. Example fix in Node.js
4. Perform Input Validation: Reject any input containing special SQL characters like ', --, ; where not appropriate.



## Fixing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Problem:
Unsanitized user input allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript via event attributes like onerror.

### Fix Steps:
1. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and prevent inline script execution.
2. Use well-maintained libraries to sanitize user input and encode outputs, such as DOMPurify or OWASP Java Encoder.
3. Avoid rendering user input directly as HTML. Instead, output it as plain text where appropriate.



## Fixing Insecure Login Flow (Brute Force Attack)

### Problem:
No rate-limiting or account lockout mechanism allows unlimited login attempts to guess passwords.

### Fix Steps:
1. Implement Account Lockout: Temporarily block an account after a predefined number of failed login attempts.
2. Use CAPTCHA (like Google reCAPTCHA) to prevent automated login attempts.
3. Enforce a Strong Password Policy: Minimum length, complexity rules (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters).


## Conclusion

Applying these recommended fixes will significantly improve the security posture of OWASP Juice Shop by mitigating SQL Injection, XSS, and insecure login vulnerabilities.
